NDCN -Omics Browser (omicser TBC)
CZI, NDCN -Omics Browser
Data exploration playground for general -omics sharing.  Developed as part of the NDCN Open Science initiative Data Science Pilot March-Sept 202.


## Installation

You can install the current version of omicser from giuthub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("omicser")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(omicser)
## basic example code
```


```{r}



devtools::build_readme()

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
