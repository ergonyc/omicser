NDCN -Omics Browser (omicser TBC) CZI, NDCN -Omics Browser Data
exploration playground for general -omics sharing. Developed as part of
the NDCN Open Science initiative Data Science Pilot March-Sept 202.

## Installation

You can install the current version of omicser from giuthub with:

`devtools::install_github("omicser")`

``` r
x <- 1
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(omicser)
## basic example code
```

`devtools::build_readme()`

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
